The fibonacci.py file shows the fibonacci sequence.
For this the FiboIter class was created which can receive or not the maximum number of iterations
that you want to perform, in the case that the maximum number of iterations is not established, 
the infinite numbers of the fibonacci sequence will be returned.
To show the elements of the sequence, a for cycle and the function time.sleep() are used,
 this last one allows to return in a determined time each number of the sequence.
